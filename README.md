1) Typescript
2) Drag and drop kanban style to do list
3) Custom hooks

**Still to do**
1) Fix the glitch when items are dragged
2) Add a ci/cd pipeline to automatically deploy once tests are passed via github to s3
3) Create a login and sign up so the protected route can work
4) Show the saved board for a selected user
5) Creat testing with jest and react testing library which would include the following tests
   Login 
i)If the user is not logged in they are taken to the login screen
ii)If their login is unsucessfult they get a message saying â€œlogin unsuccessful
iii) If they try to go directly to the board route without authentication they are sent back to the log in screen
iv) If the user deletes an item, it will not show in the ui anymore
If the user edits a todo and save the ui is updated 
v) If you click edit the field changes from to become editable
Create
vi) If I create a todo it shows in the ui
